# Return Types

You canl also annotate the type that you expect a function to return. When you know what types go into and come out of a function, you can (probably) use it without having to read every line of the function body. Return types come after the parameter list, before the colon:

```py
def add_gold(current_gold: int, found_gold: int) -> int
    return current_gold + found_gold
```

The `-> int` means this function is expected to return an integer.

The syntax is a bit different from type hints on variables and parameters: we use `->` instead of `:`, and there's no variable name before the type hint. This is because it doesn't really matter what name (if any) the function uses internally for the return value; we just care about the type.

Here's another example:

```py
def get_greeting(player_name: str) -> str:
    return f"Welcome, {player_name}!"
```

The `-> str` means this function is expected to return a string.

## Assignment

Fantasy Quest uses item descriptions in shop menus. The `get_item_description` function already works, and its parameters already have type hints.

Add a `str` return type hint to `get_item_description`. Don't change the function body.
