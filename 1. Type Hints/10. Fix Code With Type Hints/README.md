# Fix Code With Type Hints

When type hints and code behavior disagree, one of them is wrong.

If you know that you've propertly typed a function signature, you can use it as the "source of truth", or as a clue for how the implementation should work.

## Assignment

Fix the body of `summarize_quest_rewards`. It should return a list of tuples, where each tuple contains:

- The quest name (a string)
- The XP reward for that quest (an integer)

Currently, it adds the XP integer only, instead of the full tuple.
